# React(JS) application with Apollo Client and Graphql

Application that allows you to consult data about the Star Wars movie, about its characters, scenes and clothes.

## Development process

To develop it there was a period of 4 days. During those 4 days this was the process:

### Technologies

- React(JS).
- CSS.
- [Fontawesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/icons)
- [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/)
- [Graphql](https://graphql.org)
- [Firma - desing](https://www.figma.com/file/Ceoqa8DbrtyKoOBDR77ktm/Ravn-Code-Challenge?node-id=0%3A1)

All the documentation I use is in the links I just shared.

### Setting

First set up Apollo:

Then I did a simple routing so I can have all my views sorted.

To check that the route worked correctly I had to do tests and confirm that everything was fine.

Before consuming the data in the code, I had to read the documentation and avoid making mistakes or wasting time looking for ways to solve them.

### Frontend development

After doing all the tests, reading the documentation and having the initial configurations.\
I began to consume the data and bring all the necessary information for <<allPeople>>

Here we can see the first result.

Finally we obtain the general data of each character.
<p align="center"> <img src="https://github.com/12aptor/Ravn-Challenge-V2-Paolo/blob/master/src/Img/get%20general%20information.png" width="600"/> </p>

This would be your view.

**Note: We had some problems configuring the requests but they could be solved and they were not much of a problem.**
