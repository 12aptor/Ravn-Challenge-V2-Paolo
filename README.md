# React(JS) application with Apollo Client and Graphql

Application that allows you to consult data about the Star Wars movie, about its characters, scenes and clothes.

## Development process

To develop it there was a period of 4 days. During those 4 days this was the process:

### Technologies

- React(JS).
- CSS.
- [Fontawesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/icons)
- [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/)
- [Graphql](https://graphql.org)
- [Firma - desing](https://www.figma.com/file/Ceoqa8DbrtyKoOBDR77ktm/Ravn-Code-Challenge?node-id=0%3A1)

All the documentation I use is in the links I just shared.

### Setting

First set up Apollo:

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
